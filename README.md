# Customer Segmentation Using RFM Analysis  

## Overview  
This project segments customers into actionable groups using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis. By analyzing transactional data, I identified four key customer segments to optimize marketing strategies and improve retention.  

## Key Clusters  
1. **Low-Value Customers**: 25% of customers, 2% of revenue.  
2. **At-Risk Customers**: 21.7% of customers, 1.97% of revenue.  
3. **Loyal/High-Value Customers**: 33.9% of customers, 63.95% of revenue.  
4. **Big Spenders**: 18.9% of customers, 32% of revenue.  

## Tools & Techniques  
- **Data Cleaning & RFM Scoring**: Excel  
- **Clustering**: R Programming (Elbow Method, K-means)  
- **Visualization**: Power BI  

## Recommendations  
- Focus retention efforts on **Loyal/High-Value** and **Big Spenders**.  
- Launch reactivation campaigns for **At-Risk** customers.  
- Deprioritize low-cost outreach for **Low-Value** customers.  

## Repository Structure  
- `data/`: cleaned datasets.  
- `scripts/`: R code for clustering.  
- `Visuals/`: bar, pie and scatter graphs
